## Problem Statement
Problem Statement: Multiple autonomous robots explore the arena, which is an abstraction of a farm,
and communicate with one another to complete various tasks such as deciding where seeds should be sown and/or weeds should be removed
* This theme is in response to the agricultural scenario where labor-intensive work is prevalent. 
* Multiple autonomous robots explore an arena and communicate with one another to perform tasks simultaneously. 
* The robots are programmed using Elixir language with a dashboard logging the sequence of events and remaining tasks in real-time over the Internet.

* The arena abstracts a farm, consisting of crop seeds to be planted and weeds to be removed. 
* Crop seeds that must be sowed and weeds to be removed from the farm are present in the arena; necessary actions are taken by two or more robots. 
* These robots work collaboratively and communicate with each other to explore the unknown farm and determine where seeds should be sown and/or weeds should be removed. 
* If one of the robots fail, the residual task may be taken over by another. The team that completes tasks in the shortest amount of time with minimum penalties wins.
